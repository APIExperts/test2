# Rick and Morty API
## ***Motivation***
Motivation for this project was to help practice my React understanding and usage.
To discover new techniques and ideas. 




## Code Style
React

## Code Thoughts and Approach
**Create a Nav Bar and Footer**

**- Nav Bar Features**
 Search section for exact character
 Home page section
 Random Ricks Section
 Random Mortys Section
 Random Aliens Section
 Favourite characters

**- Footer Features**
Search section for episodes


**Character Search**
 When characters are searched a picture and properties will of the character will show. 


**Episode Search**
 Information about the spide will be displayed.

**Random Section** 
  random characters of that type will be shown


 ### Technologies Used

### useState
This is used to update

### React
A javascript library to build interfaces

### useEffect
This is used to rerender with dependency 
### React Router Dom
This helps us create a clean webpage with nav bar and routes. 

### flexbox



### Problems 

## event.target and onclick
 -I had an issue with making the button return a certain value.
 -I consololed log with the event actually was in order to better understand what I could do.
-I ended up making the code return a specific value depending on the button clicked.
-There may have been a better approach.
-onclick is a short hand approach to event listener but only for the click


### design background
I wanted to make a live animated background but ended up with a more classic approach. 

### Reset Button
I originally had my reset button refresh the page.
I then decided to reset my score and results to empty strings instead


### Check Score
I'm still trying to figure out how to make an animated window pop up instead of window prompt to print the score.


### design sound
I would like there to be sounds in the background.

### design icons
I'd like my icons to be animated. 


Installation Instructions

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
